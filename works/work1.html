		<h5>Description</h5>
		<p>Drama Club taught me how to be a producer, director, actress, scripter, and leader. We made numerous small plays
			and a
			big play with Culture Shock. I got to live as different characters through acting. Check out some videos of my
			acting as
			a part of this reflection. I must admit, the best part of the drama club was performing. Before the performance,
			the
			preparations made me stress but when I finally got to perform I forgot about all my nervousness. The thunderous
			clapping
			of the audiences was my reward for all the work.
			The first picture is from our meeting in putting up a play. While the video displays my acting bloopers when we made a video.
