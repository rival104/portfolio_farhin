		<h5>Description</h5>
		<p>Drama Club taught me how to be a producer, directer, actress, scripter, and leader. We made numerous small plays and a big play with Culture Shock. I got to live as different characters through acting. Check out some videos of my acting as a part of this reflection. I must admit, the best part of drama club was performing. Before the performance the preparations made me stress but when I finally got to perform I forgot about all my nervousness. The thunderous clapping of the audiences was my reward for all the work.</p>
