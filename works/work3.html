		<h5>Description</h5>
		<p>I was the proctor for the seventh-grade test in 2018 and later in 2019, I chose to become the interviewer. This
			let me
			experience the process from the other side. Since I was once in their shoes I tried my best to make them feel less
			stressed and just enjoy the process. During the interview, we heard more laughter than silence. Another
			accomplishment I
			felt from volunteering was seeing the students I interviewed and proctored get in the school.
			The pictures aboove are taken with the other proctors. We have been doing this for 3 years.
