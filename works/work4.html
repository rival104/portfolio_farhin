    <h5>Description</h5>
    <p>The first thing you see when you come to the Parent teacherâ€™s conference is me greeting you with papers. Since I came to
    this school I have been volunteering for the front desk in every parent-teacher conference. I loved working at the front
    desk because I was able to greet all the parents and be helpful. Other jobs included setting up fliers, collecting
    donations, directing the parents and cleaning up.
