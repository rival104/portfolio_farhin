    <h5>Description</h5>
    <p>Our CAS project is focused on learning about human rights issues through reading and analyzing books. My peers and I
    have started a book club that takes place every Wednesday at BSGE to examine selected works. In addition, we created a
    book drive to donate and raise more awareness about critical issues.
    The first book we examined in our book club was The Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini. We also raised money from
    bake sales to buy more books in addition to the donations.</p>
