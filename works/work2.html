		<h5>Description</h5>
		<p>After all the rigorous academic pressure I always looked forward to this dance club. Where I could let the music flow
		through my blood. At first, I was very nervous and felt awkward when I danced in front of people. The dance leaders
		taught me different techniques to forget about the eyes and be confident when dancing. I have learned to be confident in
		my body. Another thing I noticed is that I lost some weight after starting to dance. When I do exercise my body tends to
		give up but when dancing it keeps moving because of the adrenaline. We performed in culture shock but in 2019 there was
		no culture shock, so we displayed our dance on Instagram live.
